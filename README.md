# simulation_freq_bnnlib

This repository contains R-code for running a simulation study on a Tardis Cluster and was developed as part of my work as a student assistant for Andreas Brandmaier in cooperation with Aaron Peikert at MPIB (Max-Planck Institute of Human Development) in Berlin.

`bnnlib` is a R-package (under development) by Andreas Brandmaier that allows the flexible creation of different neural network models in R. 

One of the examples in the bnnlib vignettes aims at predicting different frequencies e.g. of some oscillating object (see `frequencies.Rmd` in `bnnlib/vignettes/`). 

This example was extended here to test the influence of different number of layers and different number of cells per layer on training and test errors.
